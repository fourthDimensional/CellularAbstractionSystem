# Overview

The Cellular Abstraction System is a system designed to increase the performance of cellular automata system 
exponentially by automatically identifying reoccurring patterns within the simulation, modeling them, and then 
abstracting them away into simpler to compute entities.

# Dependencies

This project uses the uv tool for environment and package management. Dependencies are detailed in the "pyproject.toml" file.

The main dependencies include:
- Numpy for accurate numerical computations.
- Pydantic for consistent data validation and typing.
- Pygame for rendering.
- Pytest for testing.

# AI Disclaimer

This project was written with the assistance of AI tools.

AI, mostly Co-Pilot, was used to generate docstrings and documentation as well as some repetitive elements like UI rendering.

AI was also used to generate some tests and write commit messages (because I am lazy).

The core of the project was written by me, and I have reviewed all AI-generated code to ensure it meets the project's requirements and standards.
